This script is a simplistic script that allows you to specify artists that you follow,
and then see a list of all of their releases in order from newest to oldest.

Example:
./tracker.py --json following.json > releases.txt

To add artists:
./tracker.py --json following.json --artists "Anamanaguchi" "Aesop Rock" "Tengger Cavalry"

To manually add artists after a failed lookup, edit following.json and replace the 'null' with the correct Musicbrainz ID.
